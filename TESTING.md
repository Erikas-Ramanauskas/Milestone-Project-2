## Testing
Testing was carried out at every point in the development to check for issues with the code, responsiveness, design, interactivity and accessibility. The developer tools used primarily were Chrome DevTools, with the console playing a key factor in testing and debugging.

Each page has been inspected using google chrome developer tools and lighthouse Firefox inspector tool to ensure that each page is fully responsive on a variety of different screen sizes and devices. I also physicaly tested the webiste on the Iphone 12, Ipad air, Macbook and Pc computers.


## AUTOMATED TESTING

### W3C Validator

### Validation Results

The W3C Markup Validator and the W3C CSS Validator were used to test and validate every all six pages of 
the Tedoku interactive project to ensure that there were no syntax errors in the code. Chrome's 
Lighthouse DevTool was also used to test for Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices and SEO. 
JSHint was used to test JavaScript code quality.

### JavaScript Validator

[jest](https://jestjs.io/) was used to validate the JavaScript.

In order to validate a developer writen test some code unfortunately must be comented out due to asynchronus Javascript issues. As i started testing at first these errors were thrown in. 

First was having issue with Jquery $ being an error and program not finding jquery variables (i did not taken screenshot of this). I have specificaly changed all of the code from using Jquery to Vanila Javascript as i did not used much of Jquery during the programign process, but it did not solve the problem. However Mentor Gareth provided with [this](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/2337) that solved first problem.

The other one were by bootstrap not being found. So i moved from linking external bootrap and jquery to downloading both of libraries directly to the project and linking it up. However this did not solve the problem. Upon Using Tutor assistance, Alan sugested not to use the code at all. Which was part of my important code for game over functionality. So i decided to disable it for automated testing and bring back for actual functionality.

/assets/scripts/game-setup.js line-32
```` 
const menuModal = new bootstrap.Modal(document.getElementById("staticBackdrop"), {
  keyboard: false,
});
````
![Bootrap error]()

Additional note to above, had a chat with sutednt support Sean, he advised adding to my testing file: 
````
const bootstrap = require(".../../../bootstrap-5.3.0-alpha3-dist/js/bootstrap");
```` 
Which solved one problem but created another. Which by my guess is the same as next one.

The Last one is due to asynchronus javascript not finding id="volume" before the test is run and failing test imedietly. The decition was to coment it out during testing phase same as previosu problem and activate it once testing is done.

/assets/scripts/game-setup.js line-198
````volumeInput.addEventListener("input", (event) => {
  gameSettings.volume = event.target.value / 200;
  setGameVolume(); 
});
````
![addEventListener error]()

* Last take on automated testing: i have tried to make jset testign work for almost 3-4 days comeing back to it after i gave up sorlvign the isues. to what i believe and understand most of variables are not loaded before test runs and similar issues are poping every test i try to do for my functions. I dont have skills and knoweladge at this moment to find soliution for that nor there was anything in the course to prepare me for this. Since i spend to much time already on to this i decided to leave it and soly relay on manual testing instead.

## 3rd party testing during development
* Performed by selected individuals who were awere of my development plan to give a feadback of user expirence.

* My brother Kris - Advised on adding sound control for the game sound. Found opacity bug for OperaGX. Reported some weird mouse behaviour with pieces. 
* Friend Algis - Advised on colours and few design details. Moral support.
* Friend Lukas - Advised Adding aditionl 20% points for each game dificulity. Found Pieces not placing bug. Set game records.
* Friend Olegas - Js and React developer with multiple years of expirence. Shared multiple advices on how to solve the bugs and helped with a few google searches to test out certain behavours. Helped out with jest testing bugs mentioned previously by explaining asynchronus JS. Note that i made sure to avoid using his help to code midjority of functions and logic and only asked for help in critical scenarios.

## 3rd party Blind Testing
* Perfomed at least 30 min testing by people who never seen the website/aplication and were given no prior information to what it is about.

* All participants practicaly skipped reading the game rules and rushed to the game it self. It took them a few minutes to realise that the shape needs to be dragged and expectation to all of them was to either controol with buttons or just clisk once and have shape to fall were you click again. however after few minutes of game all have adjusted and did not gave a problem with drag and drop mechanics anymore. 

* With this information i have changed first game picture with a gif demonstrating drag and drop and short game idea. however i am not aware or skillfull enough to remove background from gif and it gives ctakes away some.

* Viktoria - Easy to use, good accsesebility
* Ingrida - Sturgled to find play button as navigation as the time was not sticky. Would like an easier version than easy and continous longer game.
* Justas - Strugled to understand rotations at first as well as rotation points
* Igor - initialy expected the shapes to move down as picked up in tetris and controled via keybord however after further gameplay in 5 minutes understood why the design is not like a copy of Tetris.
* Parents - Gave a feedback about colours- easy on the eyes. Gave feadback about sound that more options could be added to add more sounds chosen by player (Added to future ideas). Figured out main game rules withing 5 minutes without knowing english.
